<a id="capec-151"></a>

Abstraction: Meta  
Typical severity: Medium  
Likelihood: Medium  
Status: Stable  

Identity Spoofing refers to the action of assuming (i.e., taking on) the identity of some other entity (human or non-human) and then using that identity to accomplish a goal. An adversary may craft messages that appear to come from a different principle or use stolen / spoofed authentication credentials.
