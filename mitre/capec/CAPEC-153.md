# CAPEC-153: Input Data Manipulation

<a id="capec-153"></a>

Abstraction: Meta  
Typical severity: Medium  
Status: Draft  

An attacker exploits a weakness in input validation by controlling the format, structure, and composition of data to an input-processing interface. By supplying input of a non-standard or unexpected form an attacker can adversely impact the security of the target.

## Related CWE (1)

- [CWE-20: Improper Input Validation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html): The product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the properties that are required to process the data safely and correctly.

## Prerequisites

- The target must accept user data for processing and the manner in which this data is processed must depend on some aspect of the format or flags that the attacker can control.
