<a id="capec-306"></a>

**Abstraction:** Detailed  
**Typical severity:** Low  
**Status:** Stable  

An adversary engages in TCP Window scanning to analyze port status and operating system type. TCP Window scanning uses the ACK scanning method but examine the TCP Window Size field of response RST packets to make certain inferences. While TCP Window Scans are fast and relatively stealthy, they work against fewer TCP stack implementations than any other type of scan. Some operating systems return a

## Related CWE (1)

- [CWE-200 — Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html) — The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.

## Prerequisites

- TCP Window scanning requires the use of raw sockets, and thus cannot be performed from some Windows systems (Windows XP SP 2, for example). On Unix and Linux, raw socket manipulations require root p
