# CAPEC-310: Scanning for Vulnerable Software

<a id="capec-310"></a>

Abstraction: Detailed  
Typical severity: Low  
Status: Draft  

An attacker engages in scanning activity to find vulnerable software versions or types, such as operating system versions or network services. Vulnerable or exploitable network configurations, such as improperly firewalled systems, or misconfigured systems in the DMZ or external network, provide windows of opportunity for an attacker. Common types of vulnerable software include unpatched operating systems or services (e.g FTP, Telnet, SMTP, SNMP) running on open ports that the attacker has identified. Attackers usually begin probing for vulnerable software once the external network has been port scanned and potential targets have been revealed.

- [CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html): The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the network on which the targeted system resides.
- Software tools used to probe systems over a range of ports and protocols.

## Skills required

- [Medium] To probe a system remotely without detection requires careful planning and patience.

## Consequences

- Confidentiality / Other
- Confidentiality, Access Control, Authorization / Bypass Protection Mechanism, Hide Activities
