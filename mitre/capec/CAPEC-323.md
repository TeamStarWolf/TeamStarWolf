# CAPEC-323: TCP (ISN) Counter Rate Probe

<a id="capec-323"></a>

Abstraction: Detailed  
Typical severity: Low  
Likelihood: Medium  
Status: Stable  

This OS detection probe measures the average rate of initial sequence number increments during a period of time. Sequence numbers are incremented using a time-based algorithm and are susceptible to a timing analysis that can determine the number of increments per unit time. The result of this analysis is then compared against a database of operating systems and versions to determine likely operation system matches.
