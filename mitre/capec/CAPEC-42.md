# CAPEC-42 — MIME Conversion

<a id="capec-42"></a>

**Abstraction:** Detailed  
**Typical severity:** High  
**Likelihood:** High  
**Status:** Draft  

An attacker exploits a weakness in the MIME conversion routine to cause a buffer overflow and gain control over the mail server machine. The MIME system is designed to allow various different information formats to be interpreted and sent via e-mail. Attack points exist when data are converted to MIME compatible format and back.

## Prerequisites

- The target system uses a mail server.
- Mail server vendor has not released a patch for the MIME conversion routine, the patch itself has a security hole or does not fix the original problem, or the

## Skills required

- It may be trivial to cause a DoS via this attack pattern:LEVEL:Low
- Causing arbitrary code to execute on the target system.:LEVEL:High

## Mitigations

- Stay up to date with third party vendor patches
- Disable the 7 to 8 bit conversion. This can be done by removing the F=9 flag from all Mailer specifications in the sendmail.cf file. For example, a sendmail.cf file with these changes applied should
