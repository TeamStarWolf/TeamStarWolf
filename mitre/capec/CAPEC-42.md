# CAPEC-42 — MIME Conversion

<a id="capec-42"></a>

**Abstraction:** Detailed  
**Typical severity:** High  
**Likelihood:** High  
**Status:** Draft  

An attacker exploits a weakness in the MIME conversion routine to cause a buffer overflow and gain control over the mail server machine. The MIME system is designed to allow various different information formats to be interpreted and sent via e-mail. Attack points exist when data are converted to MIME compatible format and back.

## Related CWE (4)

- [CWE-120 — Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html) — The product copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer.
- [CWE-119 — Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html) — The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary.
- [CWE-74 — Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/74.html) — The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.
- [CWE-20 — Improper Input Validation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html) — The product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the properties that are required to process the data safely and correctly.

## Prerequisites

- The target system uses a mail server.
- Mail server vendor has not released a patch for the MIME conversion routine, the patch itself has a security hole or does not fix the original problem, or the patch has not been applied to the user's system.

## Skills required

- [Low] It may be trivial to cause a DoS via this attack pattern
- [High] Causing arbitrary code to execute on the target system.

## Consequences

- Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability / Execute Unauthorized Commands
- Integrity / Modify Data
- Availability / Unreliable Execution
- Confidentiality, Access Control, Authorization / Gain Privileges

## Mitigations

- Stay up to date with third party vendor patches
- Disable the 7 to 8 bit conversion. This can be done by removing the F=9 flag from all Mailer specifications in the sendmail.cf file. For example, a sendmail.cf file with these changes applied should look similar to (depending on your system and configuration): Mlocal, P=/usr/libexec/mail.local, F=lsDFMAw5:/|@qrmn, S=10/30, R=20/40,T=DNS/RFC822/X-Unix,A=mail -d $u Mprog, P=/bin/sh, F=lsDFMoqeu, S=10/30, R=20/40,D=$z:/,T=X-Unix,A=sh -c $u This can be achieved for the "Mlocal" and "Mprog" Mailers by modifying the ".mc" file to include the following lines: define(`LOCAL_MAILER_FLAGS',ifdef(`LOCAL_MAILER_FLAGS',`translit(LOCAL_MAILER_FLAGS, `9')',`rmn')) define(`LOCAL_SHELL_FLAGS',ifdef(`LOCAL_SHELL_FLAGS',`translit(LOCAL_SHELL_FLAGS, `9')',`eu')) and then rebuilding the sendmail.cf file using m4(1). From "Exploiting Software", please see reference below.
- Use the sendmail restricted shell program (smrsh)
- Use mail.local
