# CAPEC-612: WiFi MAC Address Tracking

<a id="capec-612"></a>

Abstraction: Detailed  
Typical severity: Low  
Status: Draft  

In this attack scenario, the attacker passively listens for WiFi messages and logs the associated Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. These addresses are intended to be unique to each wireless device (although they can be configured and changed by software). Once the attacker is able to associate a MAC address with a particular user or set of users (for example, when attending a public event), the attacker can then scan for that MAC address to track that user in the future.

## Related CWE (2)

- [CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/201.html): The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.
- [CWE-300: Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/300.html): The product does not adequately verify the identity of actors at both ends of a communication channel, or does not adequately ensure the integrity of the channel, in a way that allows the channel to be accessed or influenced by an actor that is not an endpoint.

## Skills required

- [Low] Open source and commercial software tools are available and several commercial advertising companies routinely set up tools to collect and monitor MAC addresses.

## Mitigations

- Automatic randomization of WiFi MAC addresses
- Frequent changing of handset and retransmission device
