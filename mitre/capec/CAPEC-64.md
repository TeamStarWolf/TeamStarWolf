# CAPEC-64: Using Slashes and URL Encoding Combined to Bypass Validation Logic

<a id="capec-64"></a>

Abstraction: Detailed  
Typical severity: High  
Likelihood: High  
Status: Draft  

This attack targets the encoding of the URL combined with the encoding of the slash characters. An attacker can take advantage of the multiple ways of encoding a URL and abuse the interpretation of the URL. A URL may contain special character that need special syntax handling in order to be interpreted. Special characters are represented using a percentage character followed by two digits representing the octet code of the original character (%HEX-CODE). For instance US-ASCII space character would be represented with %20. This is often referred as escaped ending or percent-encoding. Since the server decodes the URL from the requests, it may restrict the access to some URL paths by validating and filtering out the URL requests it received. An attacker will try to craft an URL with a sequence of special characters which once interpreted by the server will be equivalent to a forbidden URL. It can be difficult to protect against this attack since the URL can contain other format of encoding such as UTF-8 encoding, Unicode-encoding, etc.

## Related CWE (9)

- [CWE-177: Improper Handling of URL Encoding (Hex Encoding)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/177.html): The product does not properly handle when all or part of an input has been URL encoded.
- [CWE-173: Improper Handling of Alternate Encoding](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/173.html): The product does not properly handle when an input uses an alternate encoding that is valid for the control sphere to which the input is being sent.
- [CWE-172: Encoding Error](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/172.html): The product does not properly encode or decode the data, resulting in unexpected values.
- [CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/73.html): The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.
- [CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html): The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.
- [CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/74.html): The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.
- [CWE-20: Improper Input Validation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html): The product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the properties that are required to process the data safely and correctly.
- [CWE-697: Incorrect Comparison](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/697.html): The product compares two entities in a security-relevant context, but the comparison is incorrect.
- [CWE-707: Improper Neutralization](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/707.html): The product does not ensure or incorrectly ensures that structured messages or data are well-formed and that certain security properties are met before being read from an upstream component or sent to a downstream component.

## Prerequisites

- The application accepts and decodes URL string request.
- The application performs insufficient filtering/canonicalization on the URLs.

## Skills required

- [Low] An attacker can try special characters in the URL and bypass the URL validation.
- [Medium] The attacker may write a script to defeat the input filtering mechanism.

## Consequences

- Availability / Resource Consumption
- Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability / Execute Unauthorized Commands
- Confidentiality / Read Data
- Confidentiality, Access Control, Authorization / Gain Privileges

## Mitigations

- Assume all input is malicious. Create an allowlist that defines all valid input to the software system based on the requirements specifications. Input that does not match against the allowlist should not be permitted to enter into the system. Test your decoding process against malicious input.
- Be aware of the threat of alternative method of data encoding and obfuscation technique such as IP address encoding.
- When client input is required from web-based forms, avoid using the "GET" method to submit data, as the method causes the form data to be appended to the URL and is easily manipulated. Instead, use the "POST method whenever possible.
- Any security checks should occur after the data has been decoded and validated as correct data format. Do not repeat decoding process, if bad character are left after decoding process, treat the data as suspicious, and fail the validation process.
- Refer to the RFCs to safely decode URL.
- Regular expression can be used to match safe URL patterns. However, that may discard valid URL requests if the regular expression is too restrictive.
- There are tools to scan HTTP requests to the server for valid URL such as URLScan from Microsoft (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/urlscan.mspx).
