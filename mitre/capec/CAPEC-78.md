# CAPEC-78 — Using Escaped Slashes in Alternate Encoding

<a id="capec-78"></a>

**Abstraction:** Detailed  
**Typical severity:** High  
**Likelihood:** High  
**Status:** Draft  

This attack targets the use of the backslash in alternate encoding. An adversary can provide a backslash as a leading character and causes a parser to believe that the next character is special. This is called an escape. By using that trick, the adversary tries to exploit alternate ways to encode the same character which leads to filter problems and opens avenues to attack.

- [CWE-180 — Incorrect Behavior Order: Validate Before Canonicalize](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/180.html) — The product validates input before it is canonicalized, which prevents the product from detecting data that becomes invalid after the canonicalization step.
- [CWE-181 — Incorrect Behavior Order: Validate Before Filter](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/181.html) — The product validates data before it has been filtered, which prevents the product from detecting data that becomes invalid after the filtering step.
- [CWE-173 — Improper Handling of Alternate Encoding](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/173.html) — The product does not properly handle when an input uses an alternate encoding that is valid for the control sphere to which the input is being sent.
- [CWE-172 — Encoding Error](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/172.html) — The product does not properly encode or decode the data, resulting in unexpected values.
- [CWE-73 — External Control of File Name or Path](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/73.html) — The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.
- [CWE-22 — Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html) — The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special…
- [CWE-74 — Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/74.html) — The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could…
- [CWE-20 — Improper Input Validation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html) — The product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the properties that are required to process the data safely and correctly.
- [CWE-697 — Incorrect Comparison](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/697.html) — The product compares two entities in a security-relevant context, but the comparison is incorrect.
- [CWE-707 — Improper Neutralization](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/707.html) — The product does not ensure or incorrectly ensures that structured messages or data are well-formed and that certain security properties are met before being read from an upstream component or sent to a downstream…

## Prerequisites

- The application accepts the backlash character as escape character.
- The application server does incomplete input data decoding, filtering and validation.

## Skills required

- The adversary can naively try backslash character and discover that the target host uses it as escape character.:LEVEL:Low
- The adversar

## Mitigations

- Verify that the user-supplied data does not use backslash character to escape malicious characters.
- Assume all input is malicious. Create an allowlist that defines all valid input to the software system based on the requirements specifications. In
